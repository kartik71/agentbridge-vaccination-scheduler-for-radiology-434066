## 🔧 Workflow Steps


### 1. Case Intake
Collect, validate and normalize eligibility files from Care Management; attach a runId and timestamp for traceability.

### 2. API Discovery
Execute api discovery phase for the Tool-Use pattern: persist interim state, enforce guardrails, and emit structured JSON results.

### 3. Tool Execution
Execute tool execution phase for the Tool-Use pattern: persist interim state, enforce guardrails, and emit structured JSON results.

### 4. Triage
Triage across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 5. Intervention
Intervention across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 6. Eligibility Match
Eligibility Match across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 7. Optimization
Optimization across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 8. Documentation
Documentation across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 9. Orchestration
Assemble final payload with status, artifacts, KPIs and audit trail; store to PACS; return response JSON for the client.
